# Synchronize User Appointments with Microsoft EWS using Exchange Online

This demo application synchronizes user appointments with the Microsoft Exchange Web Service (EWS) using Exchange Online (bi-directionally). The application itself exports appointments from the DevExpress WinForms Scheduler control to EWS and imports EWS events to our award-winning WinForms Scheduler control.

## Get Started (Prerequisites)

Install the following NuGet packages:

  * Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices
  * Microsoft.Identity.Client

Register your application in Azure (see [Register a client application in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application) if you have yet to register apps on Azure). Once registered, specify `tenantId` and `clientId` in *App.config*:

```
<appSettings>
  <add key="clientId" value="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"/>
  <add key="tenantId" value="YOUT_TENANT_ID"/>
</appSettings>
```

## Implementation Details

The `GetExchangeWebService` method (*Authorization.cs*) implements authorization and obtains an [ExchangeService](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice?view=exchange-ews-api) object.

> **NOTE**
>
> If EWS is installed on a server within a domain, review the following topic to authorize and obtain the ExchangeService object: [Get started with EWS Managed API client applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/get-started-with-ews-managed-api-client-applications).

The `Synchronizer` class (*Synchronizer.cs*) implements sync APIs:

*	`GetExchangeAppointments(startSearchDate, endSearchDate)` â€” Returns standard and recurring EWS appointments for the specified time interval.
*	`ExchangeToScheduler(appointmentStorage, exchangeAppointment)` â€” Imports the specified EWS appointment to the DevExpress WinForms Scheduler.
*	`SchedulerToExchange(userAppointment)` â€” Exports the specified user appointment from the DevExpress Scheduler to EWS.

## Limitations

Synchronization does not support [changed occurrences](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/1753/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/appointments#appointment-types) if associated duration does not fall within the specified time interval.
